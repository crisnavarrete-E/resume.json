		"summary": "I am fluently bi-lingual. I have a deep-seated passion for enterprise technology. I'm an Experienced Implementation Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the internet industry. Skilled in Windows environments, Cisco IOS, Technical Support, Linux System Administration, and Databases. Strong information technology professional with a Associate's degree focused in Computer Systems Networking and Telecommunications from Miami Dade College. I've worked in tier 1 support, to tier 3 engineering. I've had the pleasure to experience different settings, from field offices, small business, and datacenter environments. I've also had the privilege to assist local government offices to ensure their technology is functioning as intended. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with hardware and software within my homelab, an enclosed rack with Cisco routers, switches, and other enterprise equipment, such as brocade and aruba/HPE, and servers where I can host services and run virtual environments. I automate processes through my scripting on both windows, and linux. I enjoy destressing by means of playing guitar or outdoor activities such as paintballing, kayaking and offroading at JW Corbett, Ocala Forest and Everglades. I hope to one day drive through MOAB. ",
