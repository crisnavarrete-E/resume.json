		"summary": "I'm a Chilean expat, I've lived in the US for over 20 years. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to call this country my home. I am fluently bi-lingual. I have a deep-seated passion for enterprise technology. I'm an Experienced Implementation Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the internet industry. Skilled in Windows environments, Cisco IOS, Technical Support, Linux System Administration, and Databases. Strong information technology professional with a Associate's degree focused in Computer Systems Networking and Telecommunications from Miami Dade College. I've worked in tier 1 support, to tier 3 engineering. I've had the pleasure to experience different settings, from field offices, small business, and datacenter environments. I've also had the privilege to assist local government offices to ensure their technology is functioning as intended. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with hardware and software within my homelab. I have an enclosed rack with cisco routers and switches, and other enterprise equipment, such as brocade and aruba, alongside networking I also run my server equipment which I use for various services. I automate processes through my scripting on both windows, and linux, but quite frankly, I use linux for 99% of any service. I enjoy destressing by means of playing guitar and other activities such as paintballing, speedball, to be exact. I also enjoy outside activities as well, like kayaking throughout Florida and venturing into locations like as JW Corbett, Ocala Forest and Everglades wild life management in my Wrangler, 6 cylinder and of course, manual. I hope to one day drive through MOAB. ",
